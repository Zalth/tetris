# Tetris
This game was created as a web game app for a coding bootcamp. My wife and I were young children in the 1980's and have fond memories of Tetris. 

**Devices that can be used**

This game was designed to be reponsive to the screen area of the browser it is being played in. It will adapt in size to the screen area used, as well as landscape vs. portrait orientation. The buttons are large enough to be used on phones and other touch screens, while keyboard controls are easier to use for non touch screens.

**What is Tetris?**

Tetris is a game where shapes fall down the game grid. Each of the shapes are made up of four square blocks arranged in different ways. The shapes can be moved left or right as well as rotated while they are falling. Once a shape touches the bottom of the play area or any part of the shape lands on top of another shape, it is stuck and a new shape begins to fall. The goal of the game is to use the shapes to complete as many lines horizontally across the board as you can before your stack reaches the top of the screen. Completed lines disappear and all lines above will shift down to take its place. The level increases every 10 lines that are completed. An increase in level increases the point values of completed lines as well as increases the drop rate of the shape.

**Game Controls**

*The shapes can be moves left or right using the corresponding arrow buttons on the screen or the arrow keys on a keyboard.
*The shapes can be rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise using the "F" and "D" keys, respectively, or by using the corresponding buttons on the screen.
